    "content": "# Python Programming Guide\n\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It's widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation. This guide will take you from the very basics to advanced concepts.\n\n## 1. Getting Started\n\n### Installation\nTo install Python, visit [python.org](https://python.org) and download the latest version for your OS. Ensure you check \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation.\n\n### Hello World\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\n## 2. Core Concepts\n\n### Variables and Data Types\nPython is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare types explicitly.\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"  # String\nage = 30        # Integer\nheight = 5.8    # Float\nis_student = True # Boolean\ncomplex_num = 1 + 2j # Complex\n```\n\n### Control Flow\nPython uses indentation to define blocks of code.\n```python\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")\nelif age >= 13:\n    print(\"Teenager\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Child\")\n\n# Loops\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\nwhile age > 0:\n    print(age)\n    age -= 1\n```\n\n### Functions\nFunctions are defined using the `def` keyword.\n```python\ndef greet(name, greeting=\"Hello\"):\n    \"\"\"Docstring explaining the function.\"\"\"\n    return f\"{greeting}, {name}!\"\n```\n\n## 3. Data Structures\n\n- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections. `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`\n- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections. `point = (10, 20)`\n- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs. `user = {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}`\n- **Sets**: Unordered collection of unique elements. `unique_ids = {1, 2, 3}`\n\n## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n\nPython supports OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def bark(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n\nmy_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\nprint(my_dog.bark())\n```\n\n## 5. Advanced Topics\n\n### List Comprehensions\nA concise way to create lists.\n```python\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n```\n\n### Decorators\nDecorators allow you to modify the behavior of a function or class.\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"Before function call\")\n        func()\n        print(\"After function call\")\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello():\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n```\n\n### Generators\nGenerators allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator.\n```python\ndef countdown(n):\n    while n > 0:\n        yield n\n        n -= 1\n```\n\n## 6. Ecosystem and Libraries\n\n- **Web**: Django, Flask, FastAPI\n- **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib\n- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn\n\n## Conclusion\nPython's simplicity makes it an excellent choice for beginners, while its powerful libraries make it indispensable for professionals in almost every field of technology.",

    "content": "# Modern JavaScript (ES6+) Guide\n\nJavaScript is the backbone of modern web development. It has evolved significantly over the years, especially with the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and later versions.\n\n## 1. Modern Syntax\n\n### Variables: let and const\nStop using `var`. Use `let` for mutable variables and `const` for constants to avoid hoisting issues.\n```javascript\nconst PI = 3.14;\nlet count = 0;\n```\n\n### Arrow Functions\nA concise syntax for writing functions that also lexically binds `this`.\n```javascript\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b;\nconst square = x => x * x;\n```\n\n### Template Literals\nString interpolation made easy.\n```javascript\nconst name = \"World\";\nconsole.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n```\n\n## 2. Asynchronous JavaScript\n\n### Promises\nPromises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.\n```javascript\nconst myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(\"Success!\"), 1000);\n});\n```\n\n### Async/Await\nSyntactic sugar built on top of Promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous.\n```javascript\nasync function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n    const data = await response.json();\n    console.log(data);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Advanced Concepts\n\n### The Event Loop\nJavaScript is single-threaded but handles concurrency via the Event Loop. It checks the Call Stack and the Callback Queue to execute code.\n\n### Closures\nA closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).\n```javascript\nfunction makeAdder(x) {\n  return function(y) {\n    return x + y;\n  };\n}\nconst add5 = makeAdder(5);\nconsole.log(add5(2)); // 7\n```\n\n### Destructuring and Spread Operator\n```javascript\n// Destructuring\nconst user = { name: \"John\", age: 25 };\nconst { name, age } = user;\n\n// Spread\nconst arr1 = [1, 2];\nconst arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4];\n```\n\n## 4. Modules\nOrganize code into reusable modules using `import` and `export`.\n```javascript\n// math.js\nexport const add = (a, b) => a + b;\n\n// main.js\nimport { add } from './math.js';\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nJavaScript is essential for any web developer. Mastering these modern features and understanding the underlying mechanics will help you write cleaner, more efficient, and bug-free code.",

    "content": "# TypeScript: The Definitive Guide\n\nTypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It compiles down to plain JavaScript but helps catch errors during development, making it invaluable for large codebases.\n\n## 1. Why TypeScript?\n- **Type Safety**: Catch bugs at compile time rather than runtime.\n- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, navigation, and refactoring tools.\n- **Readability**: Types serve as living documentation for your code.\n\n## 2. Basic Types\n```typescript\nlet isDone: boolean = false;\nlet decimal: number = 6;\nlet color: string = \"blue\";\nlet list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\nlet tuple: [string, number] = [\"hello\", 10];\n```\n\n## 3. Interfaces and Types\nDefine the shape of objects and contracts within your code.\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  email?: string; // Optional property\n  readonly createdAt: Date; // Read-only property\n}\n\nfunction printUser(user: User) {\n  console.log(user.name);\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Generics\nWrite reusable code components that work with a variety of types.\n```typescript\nfunction identity<T>(arg: T): T {\n  return arg;\n}\n\nlet output = identity<string>(\"myString\");\nlet numOutput = identity<number>(100);\n```\n\n## 5. Advanced Types\n\n### Union and Intersection Types\n```typescript\ntype ID = string | number;\ntype Employee = Person & Worker;\n```\n\n### Utility Types\nTypeScript provides several utility types to facilitate common type transformations.\n- `Partial<T>`: Makes all properties optional.\n- `Pick<T, K>`: Constructs a type by picking a set of properties `K` from `T`.\n- `Omit<T, K>`: Constructs a type by picking all properties from `T` and then removing `K`.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Todo {\n  title: string;\n  description: string;\n}\n\nfunction updateTodo(todo: Todo, fieldsToUpdate: Partial<Todo>) {\n  return { ...todo, ...fieldsToUpdate };\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nTypeScript improves the developer experience and code quality significantly. It is now considered a standard for modern web development, especially in the React and Angular ecosystems.",

    "content": "# Rust Programming: Safe Systems\n\nRust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It prevents memory errors without using a garbage collector, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.\n\n## 1. The Ownership Model\nThe central feature of Rust is ownership. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.\n\n**Rules of Ownership:**\n1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its *owner*.\n2. There can only be one owner at a time.\n3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.\n\n```rust\n{\n    let s = String::from(\"hello\"); // s is valid from this point forward\n    // do stuff with s\n}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid\n```\n\n## 2. Borrowing and References\nYou can have references to a value without taking ownership. This is called borrowing.\n\n```rust\nfn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {\n    s.len()\n}\n```\n\n**Rules of References:**\n- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.\n- References must always be valid.\n\n## 3. Pattern Matching\nRust has powerful pattern matching that works hand-in-hand with Enums.\n```rust\nenum Message {\n    Quit,\n    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n    Write(String),\n    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),\n}\n\nmatch msg {\n    Message::Quit => println!(\"Quit\"),\n    Message::Move { x, y } => println!(\"Move to x: {}, y: {}\", x, y),\n    _ => println!(\"Other\"),\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Error Handling\nRust uses `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and `panic!` for unrecoverable errors.\n```rust\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nlet f = File::open(\"hello.txt\");\n\nlet f = match f {\n    Ok(file) => file,\n    Err(error) => panic!(\"Problem opening the file: {:?}\", error),\n};\n```\n\n## 5. Concurrency\nRust's ownership system also ensures thread safety. \"Fearless Concurrency\" allows you to write concurrent code without worrying about data races.\n\n## Conclusion\nRust has a steep learning curve due to its borrow checker, but it offers unparalleled performance and safety guarantees, making it a favorite for system tools, web assembly, and embedded development.",

    "content": "# Go (Golang) Programming Guide\n\nGo is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. It was designed at Google to solve problems of scale.\n\n## 1. Core Philosophy\nGo emphasizes simplicity and readability. It has a small standard library and lacks many features found in other languages (like inheritance or generics until recently) to keep the language simple.\n\n## 2. Goroutines\nGoroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They are incredibly cheap to create.\n```go\nfunc say(s string) {\n    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {\n        fmt.Println(s)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    go say(\"world\")\n    say(\"hello\")\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Channels\nChannels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine.\n```go\nch := make(chan int)\n\ngo func() {\n    ch <- 42 // Send value to channel\n}()\n\nval := <-ch // Receive value from channel\nfmt.Println(val)\n```\n\n## 4. Interfaces\nInterfaces in Go are satisfied implicitly. If a type implements all the methods of an interface, it implements the interface.\n```go\ntype Shape interface {\n    Area() float64\n}\n\ntype Circle struct {\n    Radius float64\n}\n\nfunc (c Circle) Area() float64 {\n    return 3.14 * c.Radius * c.Radius\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Error Handling\nGo treats errors as values. There are no exceptions. This forces developers to handle errors explicitly.\n```go\nf, err := os.Open(\"filename.ext\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n}\n```\n\n## 6. The Standard Library\nGo comes with a powerful \"batteries-included\" standard library, especially for networking (net/http) and text processing.\n\n## Conclusion\nGo is fantastic for cloud-native applications, microservices, and distributed systems due to its performance, simplicity, and built-in concurrency support.",

While it has a reputation for complexity, modern C++ has introduced features that make it safer and more expressive.\n\n## 1. Modern Features\n\n### Auto Keyword\nLet the compiler deduce the type.\n```cpp\nauto x = 5; // int\nauto y = 3.14; // double\nauto ptr = &x; // int*\n```\n\n### Smart Pointers\nManage memory automatically and avoid memory leaks. Never use `new` and `delete` manually again.\n```cpp\n#include <memory>\n\n// Unique pointer: exclusive ownership\nstd::unique_ptr<int> p1 = std::make_unique<int>(5);\n\n// Shared pointer: shared ownership\nstd::shared_ptr<int> p2 = std::make_shared<int>(10);\n```\n\n### Lambda Expressions\nAnonymous functions for short snippets of code.\n```cpp\nauto add = [](int a, int b) { return a + b; };\nint result = add(2, 3);\n```\n\n## 2. Move Semantics\nMove semantics allow resources to be transferred from one object to another rather than copied, which significantly improves performance.\n```cpp\nstd::vector<int> v1 = {1, 2, 3};\nstd::vector<int> v2 = std::move(v1); // v1 is now empty, v2 has the data\n```\n\n## 3. The Standard Template Library (STL)\nThe STL provides a set of common classes for C++, such as containers and algorithms.\n- **Containers**: `vector`, `list`, `map`, `set`\n- **Algorithms**: `sort`, `find`, `transform`\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<int> v = {4, 1, 3, 5, 2};\nstd::sort(v.begin(), v.end());\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nModern C++ makes the language safer and more expressive while maintaining its performance. It remains the top choice for game engines, high-frequency trading, and resource-constrained systems.",

    "content": "# Docker and Containerization\n\nDocker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development called a container.\n\n## 1. Why Docker?\n- **Consistency**: Works the same on your laptop, your coworker's laptop, and the production server.\n- **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated environments.\n- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to Virtual Machines.\n\n## 2. The Dockerfile\nA text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.\n```dockerfile\n# Base image\nFROM node:18-alpine\n\n# Working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy dependencies\nCOPY package*.json ./\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN npm install\n\n# Copy source code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Expose port\nEXPOSE 3000\n\n# Start command\nCMD [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n```\n\n## 3. Essential Commands\n- `docker build -t my-app .`: Build an image from a Dockerfile.\n- `docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app`: Run a container.\n- `docker ps`: List running containers.\n- `docker stop <container_id>`: Stop a container.\n\n## 4. Docker Compose\nDefine and run multi-container Docker applications using YAML.\n```yaml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  web:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:5000\"\n  redis:\n    image: \"redis:alpine\"\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nDocker solves the \"it works on my machine\" problem and is a fundamental tool in modern DevOps practices.",

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.\n\n## 1. Core Concepts\n\n### Pods\nThe smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. A Pod contains one or more containers.\n\n### Deployments\nDescribe a desired state for your Pods (e.g., \"I want 3 replicas of my web app\"). K8s ensures the actual state matches the desired state.\n\n### Services\nAn abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: MyApp\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 9376\n```\n\n## 2. Architecture\n- **Control Plane**: Manages the cluster (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd).\n- **Nodes**: Worker machines that run the applications (Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime).\n\n## 3. Helm\nHelm is the package manager for Kubernetes. It helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.\n\n## Conclusion\nKubernetes is the standard for container orchestration in the cloud, enabling massive scalability and high availability.",

    "content": "# React: The Complete Guide\n\nReact is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently.\n\n## 1. Components and Props\nReact apps are built using components. Components accept inputs called \"props\" and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.\n```jsx\nfunction Welcome(props) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Hooks\nHooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\n### useState\n```jsx\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n```\n\n### useEffect\nPerform side effects (data fetching, subscriptions) in function components.\n```jsx\nuseEffect(() => {\n  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n}, [count]); // Only re-run if count changes\n```\n\n## 3. Context API\nContext provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.\n\n## 4. Performance Optimization\n- **useMemo**: Memoize expensive calculations.\n- **useCallback**: Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.\n- **React.memo**: Higher-order component for memoizing functional components.\n\n## Conclusion\nReact's component-based architecture and powerful ecosystem make it the most popular frontend library today.",

    "content": "# Vue.js Guide\n\nVue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.\n\n## 1. Template Syntax\nVue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying component instance's data.\n```html\n<span>Message: {{ msg }}</span>\n```\n\n## 2. Directives\nDirectives are special attributes with the `v-` prefix.\n- `v-if`: Conditional rendering.\n- `v-for`: List rendering.\n- `v-bind`: Attribute binding.\n- `v-on`: Event handling.\n\n```html\n<button v-on:click=\"count++\">Count is: {{ count }}</button>\n```\n\n## 3. Composition API\nA set of APIs that allows us to author Vue components using imported functions instead of declaring options. It provides better logic reuse and code organization.\n```javascript\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n    function increment() {\n      count.value++\n    }\n    return { count, increment }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nVue offers a great balance between simplicity and power, making it a favorite for many developers.",

NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.\n\n## 2. Components\nComponents define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data.\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'my-app';\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Dependency Injection (DI)\nAngular has a powerful DI system that allows you to keep your component classes lean and efficient. You define dependencies in services and inject them where needed.\n\n## 4. RxJS\nAngular makes use of RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) for handling asynchronous operations and events. Observables are a key part of the Angular HTTP client and event system.\n\n## Conclusion\nAngular provides a complete solution with tooling and best practices included, making it ideal for large enterprise applications.",

    "content": "# MongoDB Guide\n\nMongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.\n\n## 1. Core Concepts\n\n### Documents and Collections\nInstead of tables and rows, MongoDB uses collections and documents.\n- **Document**: A record in a MongoDB collection and the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Documents are analogous to JSON objects but exist in the database in a more type-rich format known as BSON.\n- **Collection**: A grouping of MongoDB documents. A collection is the equivalent of an RDBMS table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": ObjectId(\"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\"),\n  \"title\": \"MongoDB Overview\",\n  \"description\": \"MongoDB is no sql database\",\n  \"by\": \"tutorials point\",\n  \"url\": \"http://www.tutorialspoint.com\",\n  \"tags\": [\"mongodb\", \"database\", \"NoSQL\"],\n  \"likes\": 100\n}\n```\n\n## 2. CRUD Operations\n```javascript\n// Create\ndb.users.insertOne({ name: \"Alice\", age: 25 })\n\n// Read\ndb.users.find({ age: { $gt: 18 } })\n\n// Update\ndb.users.updateOne({ name: \"Alice\" }, { $set: { age: 26 } })\n\n// Delete\ndb.users.deleteOne({ name: \"Alice\" })\n```\n\n## 3. Aggregation Framework\nThe aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into aggregated results.\n\n```javascript\ndb.orders.aggregate([\n   { $match: { status: \"A\" } },\n   { $group: { _id: \"$cust_id\", total: { $sum: \"$amount\" } } }\n])\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nMongoDB is great for rapid development, content management systems, and handling unstructured data.",

The Basics\n- **Repository (Repo)**: A directory which contains your project work, as well as a few files (hidden by default in the .git directory) which are used to communicate with Git.\n- **Commit**: A snapshot of your repo at a specific point in time.\n\n## 2. Essential Commands\n- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.\n- `git clone <url>`: Clone an existing repository.\n- `git status`: Check the status of your changes.\n- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit.\n- `git commit -m \"message\"`: Commit staged changes.\n- `git push`: Push commits to a remote repository.\n- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.\n\n## 3. Branching and Merging\nBranching allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.\n\n```bash\n# Create and switch to a new branch\ngit checkout -b feature-login\n\n# Switch back to main\ngit checkout main\n\n# Merge feature branch into main\ngit merge feature-login\n```\n\n## 4. Advanced Git\n- **Rebase**: Reapply commits on top of another base tip. Useful for keeping a clean history.\n- **Stash**: Temporarily shelve (or stash) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later.\n\n## Conclusion\nGit is the industry standard for version control.
